**Author:** Imeda Sheriphadze  
**Role:** Enterprise Network Architect | IT & Software Specialist  

AuroraShield is a Cisco-based enterprise network architecture designed to demonstrate real-world routing, segmentation, and security controls in a multi-layer topology.

A key objective of this project is **serverless enterprise operations** — the network is designed to operate **without Windows Server dependency**, relying on Cisco-native features and protocol-driven telemetry.

- **Monitoring & visibility:** SNMPv3, Syslog, NetFlow readiness
- **Operational model:** Serverless approach (no Windows Server dependency)
