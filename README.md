## Project Overview

AuroraShield Enterprise Network Architecture is a comprehensive multi-layer Cisco-based network design built to reflect real-world enterprise infrastructure deployment models.

This project demonstrates applied networking engineering expertise through implementation of hierarchical topology design, secure segmentation, routing governance, and management plane isolation. The architecture leverages native Cisco capabilities to maintain deterministic control, reduce external dependency, and minimize attack surface exposure.

This repository serves as a professional portfolio demonstration and technical reference implementation.
